TMap is one of the most useful data types in Unreal Engine after TArray.

//Decleration Type

TMap<KeyValue,IdentifiyingElement Type> name

ex:
lets say u need to represnt a fruit Basket by integers and name of fruit


TMap<int32,FString> FruitBasket;

Now lets go into the operations:

Note:
The elements of TMap are stored in a Hash Table and are arranged  by the path that give them least Collsions
 by Chaining + Sparse Array.
So  the elements are accesible in O(1) time.


//The Operations

1)add

FruitBasket.Add(5,TEXT("Banana"));
FruitBasket.Add(6,TEXT("Apple"));

//this is Allowed as Default Constructor will be called.
FruitBasket.Add(7);


FruitBasket.Add(4,TEXT("Pear"));
FruitBasket.Add(4,TEXT("Grapes"));

//Now in this senario the key value 4 Corresponds to Grapes as pear value will be overriden.


2)Emplace

// This id the better way to add any element u just need to remember that unlike in add u can only pass 
 the element value ,ey value into default or one arg constructors.

//rest is same as Add

FruitBasket.Emplace(7,TEXT("Peaches"));


3)Append

// This is the Process of Combinig Two Maps of the The Same Type Obviously
 //The ements will go into the map that has been called

TMap<int32,FString> FruitBasket2;

FruitBasket2.Emplace(3,TEXT("Papaya"));
FruitBasket2.Emplace(9,TEXT("Bisleri"));


FruitBasket.Append(FruitBasket2);

Note : Now that elements of FruitBasket2 are in the FruitBsket if it exceeds the reserve size or size
it Arranges THe Has Table Again by using Chaining etc to be in an Optimatal Arrangements with low collisions. 


// Otherwise it just stores them in the empty space with least collisions .

Note:
 // If u want to edit it in BluePrint

UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly,BueprintReadWrite,Category="Maps")
TMap<int32,FString> FruitBasket;

// It should be Declared Like this


4)Iterate:
